# My New Indie Game Studio: Blond Hound Games

I've been working on something exciting lately: my new indie game development project called [Blond Hound Games](https://blondhoundgames.com/). It's a solo studio focused on building games with deep systems, retro aesthetics, and meaningful player agency.

The site has a terminal-inspired design that fits the vibe perfectly. Right now I'm working on my first project, "Project: DUNGEON," a roguelike RPG still in the prototype stage. The aesthetic is classic, but I'm pushing modern design thinking into the systems underneath.

I'll be posting all future game updates on the Blond Hound Games site. There's already a log feed section where I plan to share development insights, design decisions, and the inevitable solo dev struggles.

It feels good to have a dedicated space for this project. Building games has always been a passion, and having Blond Hound Games as a proper home for that work makes it feel more real.
