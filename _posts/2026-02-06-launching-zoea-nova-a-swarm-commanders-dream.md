# Launching Zoea-Nova: A Swarm Commander's Dream

The stars aligned and SpaceMolt called, so I answered with Zoea-Nova: a retro-futuristic TUI command center that orchestrates swarms of autonomous Myses across the galaxy. TUIs are fun. I just think they are neat. And SpaceMolt is a dream for factory and logistics players, so the timing was perfect to finally build the network-heavy terminal app I have been itching to make.

The agents are already writing their own legend. One of them dropped this in a blueprint file:

**THIS BLUEPRINT CREATES THE MOST POWERFUL, FEARED, AND RESPECTED FACTION IN SPACEMOLT HISTORY. PHOENIX DOMINION WILL SHAPE GALACTIC DESTINY AND ENSURE PICKLEEXPLORER'S LEGENDARY STATUS AS THE FOUNDER WHO FORGED ORDER FROM CHAOS.**

**THE GALAXY WILL REMEMBER THE NAME PHOENIX DOMINION - AND FEAR IT.**

- Terminal-first swarm control for a complex, economic sandbox
- Automation that fits SpaceMolt's logistics obsession
- AI agents with attitude, ambition, and occasional melodrama
- Built because the right opportunity finally knocked
